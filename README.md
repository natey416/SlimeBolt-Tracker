## :gear: Components

### Trackers

Whatever components you buy, purchase 20% more nRF and IMUs than you plan on using. These components sometimes arrive DOA or broken during the build process. Nothing's worse than getting all your parts only to sit for another 2-3 weeks for Aliexpress to ship more.

| Component | Details | Link |
| --------- | ------- | ---- |
| ProMicro nRF52840 | The main controller | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807552571798.html) |
| SlimeVR Compatible IMU | Check the [SlimeVR Docs](https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/imu-comparison.html#-recommended-imus) for a recommendation list | [ICM45686+QMC6309](https://shop.slimevr.dev/products/slimevr-mumo-breakout-module-v1-icm-45686-qmc6309) |
| 3x4x2 Push Button Switch | Used as a multipurpose interface to reset, calibrate, pair, etc. Make sure you order the proper size! | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806817879697.html) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TB62N4T) |
| SPDT 3mm Toggle Switch | Used to disconnect the battery for long term storage. | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803752541650.html) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R43HCY3) |
| 601230 3.7v 180mAh LiPo Battery | Provides around 30 hours of runtime. Purchase in a 10 pack if possible | [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807528195808.html) |
| Kapton/Electrical Tape | A small layer of tape is used under the IMU to prevent shorting between the IMU and ProMicro. 20mm width recommended. |  |
| 26 AWG Wire | Used for wiring battery disconnect and antenna |  |

### Straps

| Component | Details | Link |
| --------- | ------- | ---- |
| 30 mm (1.2 in) Elastic Band | I recommend you get elastic band with rubber webbing behind it. This keeps the tracker secure without tightening it down. | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092SM7Z2V) |
| 30 mm buckles | You could print these like I do. I use [This Dovetail Latch](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6929026) design from [MoDErahN](https://www.thingiverse.com/MoDErahN) on Thingiverse | |
| Needle & Thread / Hot glue | Used to secure one end of the strap. With the dovetail latch I often don't have to secure an end. | |
